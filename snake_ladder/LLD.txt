Assumptions
Both files are empty, so I'm proposing a standard design for a CLI/programmable Snake & Ladder game.
Board size: default 100 (1..100). This is configurable.
Game rule chosen: "exact finish" required to win (player must land exactly on square size). I document alternatives and how to change.
Single-threaded game loop (typical CLI). Concurrency and network features can be added later if needed.
Language: Python (matching file names).

Classes:
Board : fixed size, had snakes and ladder , at 100 win
Player : store total number of player
Rule: had all rules and wiing also
main : had the interfacer to had all this classes
dice : add all number 

Methods :
1) Board: size,Snakes : top to bottom , ladder, player position
2) Player : name , add player , list of player
3) Rules: roll dice , turn, winning
4) main : init , play
5) dice : init had number , roll function
